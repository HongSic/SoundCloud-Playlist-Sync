# SoundCloud-Playlist-Sync
A utility to synchronize local directories with SoundCloud playlists and favorited lists.

This is a fork of the original utility from @StephenCasella. Besides numerous bug fixes, i've also included a few new features to improve the workings of the utility, for example:

- Automatic conversion of high quality songs to high quality MP3
- Automatic creating of playlist files, like: recently added and most liked
- UTF8 encoding support
- More metadata fields being written
- More options to change the behaviour of the sync
